# The-Effect-of-Reduced-Working-Hours-on-Fertility
This seminar paper investigates the potential correlation between reducing working hours and increased fertility as a strategy to mitigate challenges related to aging populations and labor shortages in the welfare state. Utilizing descriptive statistics from Denmark's Statistics registered data homepage, Danmarks statistik, alongside referencing two scientific articles—one examining flexible working hours' impact and another exploring unemployment's correlation with fertility—the paper concludes that reducing working hours alone does not seem to significantly boost fertility rates. It suggests that other factors such as education and unemployment also influence fertility rates and recommends considering additional factors like maternity regulations, childcare, and social benefits in future studies on the subject.
